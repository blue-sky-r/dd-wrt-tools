# dd-wrt-tools

Various command line CLI tools related to DD-WRT but intended for use on linux desktp (console).

scripts:

* [smantun](bin/smatun "Tools for Tuning the Antenna")  - Smart Antenna Tuning tool for linux CLI
*

---

# smantun = sma-ant-tun = smart antenna tuning

CLI (console) script to display client wifi parameters (signal, noise, SNR, Q) and semi-graphical 
signal quality bar plot as well as audible beeping (pitch related to signal quality). Many
configurable options (with sensible default value) are useful for adjusting the antenna / router
position to maximize signal quality (coverage). To get usage help run the script without any parameter:

    = DD-WRT = Smart Antenna Tuning = (c) 2020.04.07 by Robert =
    
    usage: smantun.sh [-v] [-b[ar] 'xX'] [-l[en] ms] [-o[ffset] Hz] [-m[ult] k] [-r[efresh] sec] [-d[emo] ['q10,q10']] [-t[imeout] sec] [router]
    
    -v         ... verbose / debug mode
    -b[ar]     ... bar plot characters (default '#_')
    -l[en]     ... beep length in ms (default 50, set to 0 to disable beeping)
    -o[ffset]  ... the lowest beep (offset) in Hz (default 100)
    -m[ult]    ... beep frequency multiplication (sensitivity) factor (default 2)
    -r[efresh] ... update frequency in seconds, float accepter (default 3)
    -d[emo]    ... demonstration mode (comma separated Q10 values, default '0,250,500,750,1000')
    -t[imeout] ... router connection timeout in sec (default 3)
    router     ... router/host with installed DD-WRT and accessible info page (hostname or ip address)
    
    Note: the beep freq. formula (Q is the signal quality between 0..100): frequency = offset + 10 * Q * mult
    
    This script will display statistics, plot signal level (text-mode) and trigger audible beep reflecting signal quality.
    This is very usefull for router antenna adjustment as you don't need to watch the screen, just listen to the beeps.
    The sound is generated by PC-SPEAKER. Make sure it is connected and functional. Use demo mode to verify
    you cen hear the beeping sound from your PC-SPEAKER clearly:
    
    > smantun.sh -d
    
    > smantun.sh -d '500,1000'
    
    To supress bar plot just assign empty string to -b[ar] parameter:
    
    > smantun.sh -b '' router
    
    To execute demo and real signal plot:
    
    > smantun.sh -d router
    
    Quick (low precision) adjustment (refresh 0.5 sec):
    
    > smantun.sh -r 0.5 router
    
    To suppress audible beeps (silent execution) just set beep length to 0:
    
    > smantun.sh -l 0 router
    
    This script executes infinite loop so use standard CTRL-C for stop and return to the command prompt.
    
    REQUIRES:
    - kernel module [ pcspkr ] (usually blackisted and not loaded so script will load module at the startup if required)
    - connected and functional PC-SPEAKER
    - wget, grep, awk
    - dd-wrt running on the target router (connected to the access point)
    
    The script does not make any changes to your system configuration. It loads kernel module [ pcspkr ] temporarily till the next reboot.
    The kernel module stays loaded after the script has been ended so if you experience any [ pcspkr ] related problems
    you might try to remove kernel module [ pcspkr ] manually by:
    
    > sudo rmmod pcspkr
    
    Tips:
    - for quick antenna adjustment use fast refresh, but be aware that you are affecting the signal by your presence
    - for high precision adjustment use slower refresh and always distance yourself from antenna after manipulation
    - you can adjust multiplication factor for increased sensitivity, higher value will trigger bigger pitch change
    - wifi card in your router needs some time to settle down so be smart with refresh speed
    
### dd-wrt
   
The wireless parameters are from DD-WRT info page - section Wireless - Access Point.
Therefore it is mainly for Client / Client-Bridge mode on the target router. However
with a little creativity you can use temporary dd-wrt client to adjust the antenna
on AP (access point) to get optimal coverage.

    Note: DD-WRT is using Q!0 as parameter for quality, which is just 10 * Q. 
    So when quality is 0..100% the 10x multiplication Q10 is 0..1000.

### implementation

The simplified workflow:
* the required kernel module is loaded if needed 
* the html page is retrieved by wget and java script function call setWirelessTable() is filtered out
* numerical parameter signal, noise, SNR, Q10 are extracted from JS setWirelessTable() call
* values are diplayed
* optional signal plot bar is displayed
* optional audible beep is generated
* loop forever (until CTRL+C)
